    <p>
        Hi, I am a full-time senior majoring in Computer Information Systems with a specialization in Health Informatics. I am an extremely motivated individual and I am interested in software development and web development. In my free time, aside from working on projects, I like to play basketball, workout, and watch TV and movies. I am skilled with different technologies, such as:
    </p>
    <ul><em>
        <li>- Eclipse</li>
        <li>- Android Studio</li>
        <li>- SQL Developer</li>
        <li>- MySQL</li>
        <li>- JDBC</li>
        <li>- Microsoft Office</li>
        <li>- Tableau</li>
    </em></ul>
    <p>
        I have some formal education in programming, as well as being self-taught. I have recently acquired the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer certification (for java se 8). Here are the languages I'm experienced with:
    </p>
    <ul><em>
        <li>- Java</li>
        <li>- Python</li>
        <li>- HTML, JavaScript, &amp; CSS</li>
        <li>- SQL</li>
    </em></ul>
    <p>
        I am very eager to find a position or an internship in which I can utilize my skills to help an organization develop and grow, as well as myself. More specifically, I am looking for a position that involves software development, or basic web development.
