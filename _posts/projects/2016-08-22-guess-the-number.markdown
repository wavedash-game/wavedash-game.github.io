### Simple Gaming Application ###

This is my first Android application.

This is a simple application in which a random number between 0 & 100 is generated and the user is supposed to try
<!--sep-->
and guess what the number is. If incorrect, the application will respond with a response of "too high" or "too low".
The user can guess until the correct answer is submitted, in which the game will alert you that you have guessed correctly.

#### This app can be useful in a number of ways: ####

- Can help to teach those learning their numbers and counting
- Can be useful when a random "pick a number" situation comes up
- Can help to waste time when there is nothing else to do

I intend to upgrade the application so that it has a more pleasant UI. I definitely also intend to add more range options then
0-100 to the application to make the app more useful.

#### Future Plans ####

In the future, I intend to:

- add a menu feature to change the range of the random number generated

Here is the app's link to [Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.ngbrown11.myfirstapp)
