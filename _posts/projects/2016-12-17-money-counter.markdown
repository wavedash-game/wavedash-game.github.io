### Simple Financial Application ###

This is a financial mobile application for counting money.
<!--sep-->

This is a simple Android application geared towards productivity. The interface has input boxes for the denominations of each US coin and bill. In these boxes the user will enter how many they have, then click the count button to proceed. At this point, the application will return the total value of the various coins and bills counted.

#### This app can be useful in a number of ways: ####

- Can help to simplify the act of counting money by performing the addition for the user
- Can help to facilitate various financial tasks

#### Future Plans ####

In the future, I intend to:

- add a feature that will enable the application to work with various other currencies
