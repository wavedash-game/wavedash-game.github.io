### Software-as-a-Service ###

A system of software applications, or software-as-a-service, for the healthcare industry.
<!--sep-->

This is a system of software applications, or software-as-a-service, connecting users to their healthcare practitioners.
The software enables the user to direct message their practitioner with a picture, and a description of what
concerns them. The practitioner will then be able to reply with a simple message to either alleviate their
patients concerns, or recommend they schedule an appointment. The software is comprised of:
- Mobile application for the patient (currently only Android)
- Mobile application for the practitioner (currently only Android)
- A desktop application for the practitioner (supported on Windows/MacOS/Linux)

#### I will add more information regarding Project PULP soon! ####
