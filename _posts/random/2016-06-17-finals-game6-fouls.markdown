### Cavs vs Warriors (Finals Game 6) ###

The integrity of the NBA is slowly being compromised by the softening of the game,
<!--sep-->
as well as the huge difference in the foul calls
made by the referees. In last nights game 6 of the Finals, the Cavaliers vs. the Warriors, there was at least two egregious foul calls
made by the referees; arguably three calls. All of these calls were not just egregious, but they were all called on one player, and
he just so happened to be the NBA's MVP.

The calls made during this game completely disrupted the flow of game and caused Stephen Curry to react in such a way that
resulted in him throwing his mouthpiece and hitting a Cleveland fan with it (granted, it was completely accidental). These asinine
calls lead to Curry ultimately receiving his first ever ejection from a basketball game. EVER! Now I'm not in any way saying that the calls
are the reason the Warriors lost Game 6, but before Curry was ejected they definitely still had a chance to make a comeback.
